## trust-constr

trust-constr optimization algorithm from the SciPy project. This is a version of the trust-constr algorithm that does not depend on the rest of SciPy. The only dependency is NumPy. The goal is to have a version of the trust-constr algorithm that can run within the Pyodide environment. This is a work in progress.
